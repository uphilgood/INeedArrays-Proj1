# Deployed Project on GitHub: https://uphilgood.github.io/INeedArrays-Proj1

The name of this application is "Food Finder"

The motivation of this project comes from the ironic struggle of having no idea what to eat for dinner despite intense hunger, which ultimately results in "Hanger." Using a food API, Edamam, as well as Google Firebase and the GIPHY API, we have developed a web-application that can help generate a random recipe based on a quiz. Additionally, for those who actually do know what they want, but are lacking a recipe, we have a search function that can lead you to several variations of recipes for your desired meal. Finally, we have a randomizer that can generate a random recipe for the truly indifferent Hangry person.

This application was built using Material.js, Edamam API, GIPHY API, Google Firebase, HTML, CSS, MaterialCSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
